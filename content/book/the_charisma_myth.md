> Charisma doesn't require you to be outgoing or attractive, or for your to change your personality. It's a skill, a discipline, and you can develop it.

Three immediate tips to be more charismatic:

1. Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentence.
2. Reduce how quickly, and how often, you nod.
3. Pause before you speak. 2 seconds is a good duration.

Being charismatic is made up of three qualities, **presence, power and warmth**. These are controlled through your body language, which is hard to directly control. Therefore, you need to work on improving your internal emotional state which will thereby improve your internal state.

As a result, discomfort (e.g., physical, emotional, ...) negatively affects how charismatic you are. Plan ahead to try and avoid discomfort, but if external discomfort happens, you could either: (a) try a *responsibility transfer* i.e. imagine it is in control of another being or (b) explain it i.e., make use of the ambiguity, if a delusional interpretation helps you, go for it.

Internal discomfort can be resolved as follows:

1. Destigmatize the experience. We *all* go through this experience, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Thoughts like we *should* feel happy are useless! It's not one emotion felt by you, but rather a shared emotion felt by many.
2. Remind yourself that your thoughts are not neccessarily accurate e.g. people assume in interactions all responses relate directly to what you have done. 
3. *Rewrite reality*: try and turn the situation on it's head and look for the positives. One nice idea is to try a letter to a person who has upset you, and then you can write their fictional response! This will help you get some closure.

> Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.

Tips for creating a charismatic mental state:

1. Visualisation.
2. **Practice** gratitude, goodwill and compassion (including self-compassion). This could include a) finding positives in a bad situation, e.g., your own abilities or things in the environment b) using a third person lens, describing your life (in a positive way) or c) imagining your own funeral. When dealing with somebody you don't like, **remind yourself of three things you like about that person**.

There are of course different types of charisma. *Focus Charisma* relies primarily on presence and makes people feel heard. *Visionary Charisma* relies on an unwavering belief in a bold vision, which is somewhat altruistic. *Kindness Charisma* involves warmth and acceptance. *Authority Charism* is achieved through the projection of power and status. Think about what you are trying to achieve in a particular situation, and use your status.

Obviously, first impressions are important, and people often make split second judgements about you. The default option for first impressions is simple: most people like people who are like them, in terms of attire, demeanor and speech. 

### First Impressions

Clothing is obviously important. People tend to find that the more formal the clothing, the more respect that people have for their opinions. *If you want to make other people feel comfortable, wear similar stuff. But if you want to impress people, look at the range of choices within the environment and choose the upper end i.e. dress to impress*. This means doing your research!

Handshakes are also important. Basically, firmly, but not too firm, and keep your hand straight. Squeeze as much as the other person does. 

Breaking the ice ... we want to have conversations which both communicate warmth but also send the conversation down th eright path. Easy way is to complement them about what they are wearing. Then, **open ended questions** are key e.g. what is the story behind [XYZ]?, where are you from? And then to keep people talking, keep asking open-ended questions! 

The bounceback technique is useful: answer the question with a fact, add some personal note, and then redirect the question back to them.

> When you are speaking, the one word which should come up the most is not *I*, but rather, *you*.

Also, adapt the language to the context and the person, relating it to things that they know. 

**Graceful Exits** this is difficult. Firstly, don't wait too long to exit the conversation, because otherwise both people become uncomfortable. Best way is to have an official reason to do so. Another good way is to offer something of value, e.g. information, a connection, recognition. In the case wear you are breaking up a group, it is important to:

* have eye contact with the person(s) who will be left.

* Ask their permission.

### Speaking and Listening with Charisma
Managing a positive mental state is the first step. But then, listening charismatically is crucial. There are three key things that you need to do here:

1. Be attentive. Don't just wait for your turn to speak, actually listen.  

2. **Do not, in any circumstance, interrupt them!** But also, know when to let other people interrupt you, and don't make them feel wrong. 

3. Pause deliberately, and before you can answer. Let first your face absorb and react, and then you answer. This takes confidence to bear the silence. 

Other people will associate you with the way that you make them feel. Try and be more positive, and that will make people feel better. 

Taking a compliment! I'm not so good at this, and this means that when somebody complements you, they feel silly. Don't downplay it (again, you do this all the time). Here is what you ought to do:

1. Stop

1. Absorb the compliment. 

2. Let your face show the compliment.

3. Simply thank them, either for their thoughtfulness, or that they have made your day, or something similar. 

> You can make more friends in two months by becoming truly interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Don't try to impress people, let them impress you. 

In general, graphical metaphors are very effective in communicating information. It is also useful to try and avoid negative words in general e.g. try not to say "no worries", and replace it with something like "you're welcome", that is still far more positive. 

Vocal flucation is apparently very important, and the foundation for warmth and power. This can be fluctuation in **pitch, volume, tone, tempo or rhythm**. For power in your voice, speak slowly and pause often, and try and drop the intonation at the end. Also, make you are breathing deeply. For vocal warmth, simply **smile!!!** This works even when on the phone. 

### Charismatic Body Language
Conscious mirroring is a useful thing. By imitating somebody's body language, in a more subtle and not obvious way, you can establish trust and rapport easily. Apparently, this even makes you more attractive ... Of course, you should use variations in amplitude, have a lag time and be selective i.e., only do what actually feels natural for you to do. This also works in matching tone and pace of voice. 

**Mirror-the-lead** is also a useful technique when the person you are interacting with needs reassurance. You should mirror, and then gradually draw them out of the negative body language. 

**It is essential to respect people's personal space. It's different for everybody, so try and read the signs when you can.** Seating choices also makes a difference, being alongside somebody or 90 degrees to them is significantly less confrontational. 

**Roaming eyes are not charismatic** Don't look over somebody's shoulder to see if somebody better is going to come along, you'll make them feel bad. Good eye contact is absolutely huge. **Keep eye contact for a full three seconds at the end of your interaction**

Body language of insecurity kills charisma on the spot. Confidence can be read as how much space people are willing to take up. Additionally, confident people take fewer movement, not fidgetting for example. These people have *poise*. There are three main issues:

1. Excessive nodding: once for emphasis, or to express agreement, is fine, but nodding several times is not. 

2. Excessive verbal reassurance (e.g. "uh-huh" or "oh, I agree"). Once, and consiously, is fine, but multiple times is not.

3. Being restless, or fidgetting. This decreases presence, and thus decreases charisma. 

But this communicates power and poise. **If somebody is shy or uncomfortable, you would be best served by aggreeing with them**, and also try and project warmth. 

### Difficult Situations

#### Trying to Convince People
When trying to win over difficult personalities, try *divide and conquer*. Consider the context in which you are dealing with the other person. Also, try to *make them rationalise in your favour*, e.g., by asking them for a favour. Better to ask for their opinion rather than advice, as it is easier for them. Reminding them of the good things you have done for them will help the mind rationalise the actions, resulting in them thinking they like you. **We've rather prove ourselves correct that change our minds**. This works in reverse, so don't make people feel wrong. 

You can also do the above trick with ideas, showing people how an idea has changed due to their input (or similar).

Of course, you need to express appreciaton. All humans crave honest appreciation. **The most effective compliments are those that are both personal and specific**. 

> Getting angry is like taking a small dose of slow-acting poison. 

To avoid anger, try to get into an empathetic mindset and stay there. If you need help with this, maybe try an alternate reality. 

> Hostility is often the external manifestation of internal turmoil. 

#### Delivering Bad News
Try not to be vague in your messages, otherwise the mind will assume the worst. Of course, body language is essential, and it needs to be one of warmth. 

To do this, get yourself in the right external state. Put yourself in their shoes, and imagine both of you wth angel wings working towards a common mssiong. 

Try to express your care and concern both nonverbally and verbally. 

#### Delivering Criticism
There are four key steps:

1. Think about the timing and location, and try to be empathetic about both.
2. Get into the right mindset, of compassion and empathy. You need this to come across in your body language. You could remind them about why you are suggesting these improvements.
3. Be specific. It is better to focus on a few key points. 
4. Depersonalise; you are critiquing the behaviour, not the person. You could not mention their actions, and relate the difficulty to yourself. 

It is important to start off and end correctly. Starting with a positive beginning affects the rest of the experience. So try to start and end positive. This could mean:

1. Next steps - what will be done to improve the situation. 
2. Tell them how much your appreciate how they took your feedback. 
3. Positive future - bring up what they can look forward to in the future. 

People will try and justify what they have done; try to not make them feel too wrong. 

> The short-lived pressure of being right is sometimes not worth the long-term negative consequences.
