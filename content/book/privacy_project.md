> Charisma doesn't require you to be outgoing or attractive, or for your to change your personality. It's a skill, a discipline, and you can develop it.

Three immediate tips to be more charismatic:

1. Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentence.
2. Reduce how quickly, and how often, you nod.
3. Pause before you speak. 2 seconds is a good duration.

Being charismatic is made up of three qualities, **presence, power and warmth**. These are controlled through your body language, which is hard to directly control. Therefore, you need to work on improving your internal emotional state which will thereby improve your internal state.

As a result, discomfort (e.g., physical, emotional, ...) negatively affects how charismatic you are. Plan ahead to try and avoid discomfort, but if external discomfort happens, you could either: (a) try a *responsibility transfer* i.e. imagine it is in control of another being or (b) explain it i.e., make use of the ambiguity, if a delusional interpretation helps you, go for it.

Internal discomfort can be resolved as follows:

1. Destigmatize the experience. We *all* go through this experience, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Thoughts like we *should* feel happy are useless! It's not one emotion felt by you, but rather a shared emotion felt by many.
2. Remind yourself that your thoughts are not neccessarily accurate e.g. people assume in interactions all responses relate directly to what you have done. 
3. *Rewrite reality*: try and turn the situation on it's head and look for the positives. One nice idea is to try a letter to a person who has upset you, and then you can write their fictional response! This will help you get some closure.

> Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.

Tips for creating a charismatic mental state:

1. Visualisation.
2. **Practice** gratitude, goodwill and compassion (including self-compassion). This could include a) finding positives in a bad situation, e.g., your own abilities or things in the environment b) using a third person lens, describing your life (in a positive way) or c) imagining your own funeral. When dealing with somebody you don't like, **remind yourself of three things you like about that person**.

There are of course different types of charisma. *Focus Charisma* relies primarily on presence and makes people feel heard. *Visionary Charisma* relies on an unwavering belief in a bold vision, which is somewhat altruistic. *Kindness Charisma* involves warmth and acceptance. *Authority Charism* is achieved through the projection of power and status. Think about what you are trying to achieve in a particular situation, and use your status.
